# Last War Server 116 Schedule UI

[Simple schedule UI for reserving titles on Last War #116 server](https://www.lastwar116.com)

## Description

Schedule UI allows players from Last War to reserve a specific time for any of the available titles on the server.

Although the schedule UI should help with distributing the titles, it is not a perfect solution and will be subject to first ladies activity.

Hopefully this is the beginning to a better system for our server!
